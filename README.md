# Online Shipping Company

_Created By : Alifia Listu Samatha - JCDS Purwadhika Bandung_

In this project, I will position myself as a data analyst in a company. Based on the data obtained, I will create a series of questions based on business needs and problems that related companies may face.

I will answer questions raised by data analysis, create stories and visualizations, and present insights from the analysis that stakeholders can use to make business decisions.

## Background

An international e-commerce company wants to analyze their customer database for key insights. Several shipments did not arrive on time among the large number of shipments, resulting in potential customers giving the company low ratings.

## Problem Statement

The company wants to know whether or not the product is delivered on time. This data can help improve e-commerce customer satisfaction (minimize low ratings).
As a data analyst, we will try to answer the following questions:
1. What should be done to increase the probability of products being delivered on time?
2. What should be done to improve the customer rating?
